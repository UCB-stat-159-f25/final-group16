It can contain figures referenced from disk or simple summary information (for example if you want to display part of a dataframe) from variables read from disk, but no significant computations at all. Think of this as your “paper”.\n",

    "Author Contributions section: your main.ipynb notebook should contain, at the end, a brief section titled Author Contributions. This section should indicate, for each team member, what they did in the project. It doesn’t have to be a long, detailed story, a few sentences per person should suffice. All team members must agree to the language in this section. (By the way, this is standard practice in many scientific journals). While in principle the project grade is the same for all team members, we reserve the right to lower the grade of anyone who doesn’t contribute to the team effort."
