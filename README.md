# Final Project: NBA Player Statistical Analysis from 2024-2025 Season

## Project Overview
This project analyzes game-level NBA player statistics from the 2024–2025 season to understand player consistency, performance efficiency, and team-level factors contributing to winning. Using EDA and simple statistical models, we investigate how individual and team behaviors relate to scoring, assists, rebounds, shooting efficiency, and wins.

Our goal is to answer interpretable, basketball-relevant questions using reproducible data science workflows.
